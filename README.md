# PridePro

This project was initiated in July 2023 due to the need for swift and accessible communication with healthcare professionals who understand the needs of the LGBTQ+ community. It emerged from the experiences of users who had faced negative encounters in psychological and physical care.

Currently, it is a developing project that I am passionate about working on. I am excited about the prospect of seeing it in action, conducting outreach campaigns, and connecting with the community's needs to contribute through software use.

The project is maintained in a private repository where I update the code weekly. In this repository, I upload screenshots of the versions and code implementations that I consider public, such as the application UI, used components, and code files addressing issues encountered during development.

If you are interested in discussing or learning more about this project, please do not hesitate to contact me on LinkedIn.
